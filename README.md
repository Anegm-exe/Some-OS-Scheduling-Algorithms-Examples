# A Simple Example For Some OS Scheduling Algorithms
<ins>this Program Is Made Mainly To Show Off The Following:</ins><br>
> What Normal Execution Would Look Like<br>
> Round Robin Program Execution Alg Example<br>
> SJF (Shortest Job First) Program Execution Alg Example<br>
> Ways programs Can Interact With Each Other (Fail To Find File, Change HashMap Data, Manipulate CPU Usage)<br>

## Program Descitption
This project Was Made Mainly To ShowCase Understanding And Simulation Of Some Of The Non-Preemptive And Preemptive Algs That The OS May Use.
It Shows Diffrences Between SJF, Round-Robin And Normal-Excution And How They Work And Printing Out A Gantt Chart After Each Run. Executed Programs Can Be Changed And Manipulated As You Wish As Long As
It Uses One Of The Pre-Defined Tags That Are Used Before.

## Notes / Recommendations
1. the Game Was Part Of A Course During My Second Year AT The GIU (German International University) In Egypt Learning About Informatics And Computer Science.<br>
2. Program Was Created And Tested To Work On Eclipse IDE But Using Other IDEs Shouldn't Be An Issue As Long As The Files Are Implemented Successfully (Including The 3 Program Files).<br>
3. Feel Free You Use, Edit, Upgrade Or Share This As Long As you Credit Me.<br>
4. To Use The Algs Follow The Steps Printed In The Output Terminal.<br>
5. Files Types Can Be Used To Create Diffrent Types of Files Like ".txt", etc..<br>
6. Please Beware That Files Created Wont Be Deleted After You finish Running The Code.<br>
